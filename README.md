My name is J.D. and I'm someone learning and exploring the world of web development! Feel free to check out my repositories and offer and any critiques of my work!

ðŸ”­ I recently created an app called [PokÃ©Zoo](https://pokezoo.vercel.app/) where users can collect PokÃ©mon to gain points which they can use to increase their collection. This app was built with React and Next.js and the code can be found here [here](https://github.com/jdplumst/pokezoo). Constant updates are being made for this app.
