My name is J.D. and I'm someone learning and exploring the world of software development! I'm an enjoyer of TypeScript, Go, C# and Python. Feel free to check out my repositories!

ðŸ”­ I created an app called [PokÃ©Zoo](https://pokezoo.vercel.app/) where users can collect PokÃ©mon to gain points which they can use to increase their collection. This app was built with React and Next.js and the code can be found here [here](https://github.com/jdplumst/pokezoo). Constant updates are being made for this app.

ðŸ”­ I built a [Budget App](https://budget-app-coral.vercel.app/) with a React, TypeScript and Next.js frontend and a C# and ASP.NET backend. You can find the frontend repository [here](https://github.com/jdplumst/budget-app) and the backend repository [here](https://github.com/jdplumst/budget-app-server).
